# Problem 2

All machineAssg1_2 code is located in the `machineAssg1-2` directory. 

## Requirements

C++ compiler/interpreter. Code was developed with c++11. 


## Execution

The program can be executed with a command in the form:

```
make
```

```
./machineAssg1_2
```


## Sample Output

if run with the command: 

```
./machineAssg1_2
```

The output will be

```
epsFloat: 1.19209e-07
```

```
epsDouble: 2.22045e-16
```

Where `epsFloat` is the value computed with the variables as a float.
Where `epsDouble` is the value computed with the variables as a double.
